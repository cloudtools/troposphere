How to Test Your Code
---------------------

The latest test scripts can be found at https://travis-ci.org/cloudtools/troposphere.
If you look at the details of a job, you can see what automated tests
will be run against any commits to the project.

1. Create a virtualenv (e.g. `virtualenv ~/virtualenv/troposphere`)
#. Activate it: `source ~/virtualenv/troposphere/bin/activate`
#. `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`
#. `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
#. Run tests
    1. `pycodestyle .`
    #. `pyflakes .`
    #. `python setup.py test`
#. Alternatively, make can be used to run the tests, i.e. `make test`.

Tests are run against Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.

Contributing Example Code
-------------------------

New example code should go into `troposphere/examples`. The expected
CloudFormation Template should be stored in `troposphere/tests/examples_output/`.
When tests are run the output of the code in the examples directory will
be compared with the expected results in the `example_output` directory.
