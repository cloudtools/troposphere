About
=====

troposphere - library to create `AWS CloudFormation`_ descriptions

The troposphere library allows for easier creation of the `AWS CloudFormation
JSON`_ by writing Python code to describe the AWS resources. troposphere also
includes some basic support for `OpenStack resources`_ via Heat.

To facilitate catching CloudFormation or JSON errors early the library has
property and type checking built into the classes.

About the Viaplay Fork
===============
This is a fork kept in order to guarantee that Troposphere is always available in our organization. It is also used to use new versions of the Cloudformation specs that have not been released yet in the official Troposphere. For instructions on how to work with this fork internally see `here`: https://github.com/nentgroup/troposphere/blob/master/VIAPLAY_CONTRIBUTING.md

The release package that this project generates is called ``troppan`` instead of ``troposphere``. The reason is to always be able to switch to the "official" troposphere without any version collisions in the local Python installations. This setting can be changed though in `setup.cfg`.  

Installation
============

troposphere can be installed using the pip distribution system for Python by
issuing:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install troppan

To install troposphere with `awacs <https://github.com/cloudtools/awacs>`_
(recommended soft dependency):

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install troppan[policy]

Alternatively, you can use `setup.py` to install by cloning this repository
and issuing:

.. code:: sh

    $ python setup.py install  # you may need sudo depending on your python installation

Examples
========

A simple example to create an instance would look like this:

.. code:: python

    >>> from troposphere import Ref, Template
    >>> import troposphere.ec2 as ec2
    >>> t = Template()
    >>> instance = ec2.Instance("myinstance")
    >>> instance.ImageId = "ami-951945d0"
    >>> instance.InstanceType = "t1.micro"
    >>> t.add_resource(instance)
    <troposphere.ec2.Instance object at 0x101bf3390>
    >>> print(t.to_json())
    {
        "Resources": {
            "myinstance": {
                "Properties": {
                    "ImageId": "ami-951945d0",
                    "InstanceType": "t1.micro"
                },
                "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance"
            }
        }
    }
    >>> print(t.to_yaml())
    Resources:
        myinstance:
            Properties:
                ImageId: ami-951945d0
                InstanceType: t1.micro
            Type: AWS::EC2::Instance

Alternatively, parameters can be used instead of properties:

.. code:: python

    >>> instance = ec2.Instance("myinstance", ImageId="ami-951945d0", InstanceType="t1.micro")
    >>> t.add_resource(instance)
    <troposphere.ec2.Instance object at 0x101bf3550>

And ``add_resource()`` returns the object to make it easy to use with ``Ref()``:

.. code:: python

    >>> instance = t.add_resource(ec2.Instance("myinstance", ImageId="ami-951945d0", InstanceType="t1.micro"))
    >>> Ref(instance)
    <troposphere.Ref object at 0x101bf3490>

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples of the error checking (full tracebacks removed for clarity):
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Incorrect property being set on AWS resource:

.. code:: python

    >>> import troposphere.ec2 as ec2
    >>> ec2.Instance("ec2instance", image="i-XXXX")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: AWS::EC2::Instance object does not support attribute image

Incorrect type for AWS resource property:

.. code:: python

    >>> ec2.Instance("ec2instance", ImageId=1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: ImageId is <type 'int'>, expected <type 'basestring'>

Missing required property for the AWS resource:

.. code:: python

    >>> from troposphere import Template
    >>> import troposphere.ec2 as ec2
    >>> t = Template()
    >>> t.add_resource(ec2.Subnet("ec2subnet", VpcId="vpcid"))
    <troposphere.ec2.Subnet object at 0x100830ed0>
    >>> print(t.to_json())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: Resource CidrBlock required in type AWS::EC2::Subnet (title: ec2subnet)

Currently supported resource types
======================================

- `AWS Resource Types`_
- `OpenStack Resource Types`_

Duplicating a single instance sample would look like this
=========================================================
